# PrivEscCheck-Decoded
itm4n's Priv Esc Check Script which has been decoded and unzipped. Why? Dont want to blindly run Obfuscated PowerShell Scripts from GitHub on a Corporate Network do we?

Original Script - https://github.com/itm4n/PrivescCheck

## Awesome Script 👩‍🚀

For UK Pentesters, if running Build Reviews for ITHCs, this used alongside Nessus or whatever you are using is awesome.

Great Report Layout aswell.

## Is the code secure to run? 🔒

Im quite confident it is, I've looked through the code and also put it through https://app.any.run/

itm4n is quite well known in the industry with some great blogs etc - https://itm4n.github.io/. The repo is maintained and has over 2k stars.

## app.any.run results 💀

It has no external connections or http requests

And the only potentially "malicious" activity is some registry queries and powershell version downgrade

## Will this be updated?

If I notice itm4n has updated his script, ill update this one.

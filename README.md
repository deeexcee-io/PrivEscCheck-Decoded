# PrivEscCheck-Decoded
itm4n's Priv Esc Check Script which has been decoded and unzipped. Why? Dont want to blindly run Obfuscated PowerShell Scripts from GitHub on a Corporate Network do we?

Original Script - https://github.com/itm4n/PrivescCheck

## Awesome Script 👩‍🚀

For UK Pentesters, if running Build Reviews for ITHCs, this used alongside Nessus or whatever you are using is awesome.

Great Report Layout aswell.
